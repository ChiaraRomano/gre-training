<!-- ## Sublocation -->

<!--
[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE "PALATINE HILL"](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.

## Garden Description

The house stood in the middle of a farm complex 75 meters wide and 120 meters long. It dates to the early second century.  The house (A on the plan, Fig. 1) is of the winged corridor type, measuring 19.30 x 22.40 meters.

On the west and east, in front of and behind the house, were open *courtyards* enclosed by a wall. The western *courtyard* has been interpreted as a garden (G on plan); the eastern one may have been a *paddock*.
