<!-- ## Sublocation -->

<!--
[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE "PALATINE HILL"](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.

## Sublocation Description

Durocortorum was mentioned by Caesar as the center of the Remi, a Celtic tribe that sided with the Romans against the Belgians. It then became a federated city, nominally independent.  Under Augustus, it became the capital of Gallia Belgica. Many vestiges indicate that it was densely settled and unusually extensive.  A network of water supply and sewers has been found; an aqueduct brought water from 40 kilometers.  The cardo and decumanus are still identifiable today by vestiges of four gates with arches, the northern one still standing; they cardo and decumanus intersect at the present Place Royale.  Today, the city is known for its magnificent Gothic cathedral and its fine champagnes.

## Garden Description

BEL 2.3.1: Reims, House of the Ram
Excavated in 1992-93 by Agnès Balmelle, this vast house probably covered about 2000 square meters. The date of construction is rather uncertain; it could be as early as the end of the first century or as late as the second half of the second (Fig. 1)  The excavations have revealed a *portico* (A) (20 x 3 m) opening onto an open space which may have been a garden. It was bordered on the southwest by *drain* which no doubt collected rainwater from the roof and led it away to the northwest. A well (E) was in the north gallery or *corridor* (B).
