<!--
[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE "PALATINE HILL"](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.

## Garden Description

This villa of a farm near Echternach was of the winged corridor type with sumptuous interior marble paneling, *mosaics* and wall paintings (Fig. 1). Originally constructed in the 60s of the first century AD, the villa was enlarged until it covered an area of 8928 square meters in the third century.

The protruding wings of the house on either side of the main entrance on the north framed a large, open *courtyard*, 29 x 74 meters in size, possibly a garden (G on plan). In the middle of this *courtyard* was a masonry pool of grand proportions (14.50 x 60 meters). In the middle of this stone-paved pool was a square base which once supported a statue, a sculptural group or perhaps a crater. The pool was retained as a decorative element throughout all the alterations of the estate until the destruction of the farm in the late 4th or early fifth century
The southern *peristyle courtyard* (16.50 x 17 meters) within the house itself was initially designed as part of the bath complex in this wing, and in this *courtyard* was a swimming pool or natatio. Soon after the building of the house, the pool was filled in and the *courtyard* transformed into a garden (G on plan).

There was a garden from the very beginning in the western *peristyle courtyard*, as witnessed by the presence of garden soil (G on plan). This garden was later abandoned in the early second century.
