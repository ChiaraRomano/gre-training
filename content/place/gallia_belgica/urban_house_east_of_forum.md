## Garden Description

In only one of the excavated houses of the second and third century in two *insulae* east of the forum beneath the imperial baths can gardens be shown to have existed. This house was demolished when the imperial baths were erected in the last decade of the third century. It seems to have occupied an entire *insula* measuring 55 x 100 meters. (Fig. 1). An *atrium* (A on plan) was built in the west wing of the building in the first half of the second century. The *atrium* was later transformed into a garden with planting beds and a pool. Around the middle of the third century this garden was abandoned. The house also boasted a large *peristyle* courtyard on the east which may have been planted (G on plan), but for a garden there is no direct archaeological evidence.
