<!-- ## Sublocation -->

<!--
[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE "PALATINE HILL"](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.

## Garden Description

The villa of this rural estate of the third century and its grounds are the only parts of the complex which have been investigated (Fig. 1). The farm lay about 40 km. south of Trier on a gentle slope above the Moselle river. The villa is of the winged corridor type with a facade of over 45 meters in length, taking up an area of 4200 square meters. In the villa were two *peristyle courtyards*, but both were paved with slabs of red sandstone rather than having been laid out as gardens.

Parks were laid out on the grounds of the villa. A *peristyle corridor* 250 meters in length and 8.80 meters in width led from the villa to the *bath building* on the southwest, although it was not directly connected to either building. From the open-sided *corridor* one could enjoy the view of the almost certainly landscaped grounds, and of the terrain sloping down to the river. It is assumed that there was another *peristyle corridor* on the northeast. A grotto on the grounds of the villa belonged to the park.
