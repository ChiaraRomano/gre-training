<!-- ## Sublocation -->

<!--
[AREA WITHIN LOCATION, LIKE "PALATINE HILL"](GEOREFERENCE LINK)
A sublocation is any area larger than an individual garden, but located within a location. I would always try to include a link to a controlled vocabulary here if possible. This ID may well be different from the Garden ID, e.g., Pompeii versus a Garden in one of the houses which has its own Pleiades ID.

## Sublocation Description

Durocortorum was mentioned by Caesar as the center of the Remi, a Celtic tribe that sided with the Romans against the Belgians. It then became a federated city, nominally independent.  Under Augustus, it became the capital of Gallia Belgica. Many vestiges indicate that it was densely settled and unusually extensive.  A network of water supply and sewers has been found; an aqueduct brought water from 40 kilometers.  The cardo and decumanus are still identifiable today by vestiges of four gates with arches, the northern one still standing; they cardo and decumanus intersect at the present Place Royale.  Today, the city is known for its magnificent Gothic cathedral and its fine champagnes.

## Garden Description

BEL 2.2.1: Reims, House aux Flerurons
Along the north side runs a secondary street following the orientation of the town in Augustan times. Along this street, in the northern part of the house, a series of rooms with mosaics were found. On the south side, the space A (about 30 x 14 m) was probably a garden. The central part, surrounded on three sides by *porticos,* had two wide *trenches* (a) cut into the chalk and filled with clay, a strong indication of a garden. The *trenches* seem to be connected on the south side, and the south wall seems to be the limit of the parcel.
