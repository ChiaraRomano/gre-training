## Garden Description

The *insula* VII of the Clos du Verbe Incarné, excavated from 1977 to 1987, lies on the western slope of a little dip (71 x 34 m) in the upper town, about 160 meters northwest of the center of the top of the theater. In this *insula*, begun between 40 and 20 BC, one can follow the evolution of this quarter up to the end of the third century. To the north, the *insula* was bordered by the street called du Capitol and to the west by the street called de Cybèle. The subdivision of the *insula* was put in place from 15–10 BC. The house occupied 400 square meters, and was organized on an italic plan around a traditional *atrium* followed by a tablinum[1]. The house of seven or eight rooms did not have a peristyle but did, no doubt, include a *hortus*[2] (15 x 5 m) at the back of the lot.

The house was originally constructed of adobe on a floor and gutter of granite masonry. Later, in Tibero-Claudian times, a wooden section was added, which facilitated the creation of an upper story on the western part, which also included on the ground level some isolated shops occupying 100 square meters. The neighbor to the north was another small, 315-square-meter house, the *Domus* with the Mosaic Emblema, which was organized around a four-column *atrium*, but had no garden. In fact, the House with Pilasters was the only one in the *insula* to have, without doubt, a little green space. In the southern part of the insula, there were three combinations of house and shop, and another small, 310-square-meter house called the Domus with Lararium.
