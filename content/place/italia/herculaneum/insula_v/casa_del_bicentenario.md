## Garden Description

551.V.15-16.
Two hundred years after the first excavation efforts started at Herculaneum in 1738, this house was excavated and the restoration finished, thereby receiving its name. A passageway with windows bordered the garden (a) on the west and a *portico* with seven columns joined by a low wall stood on the east and north of this garden measuring 9.90 x 4.90 meters. A wide water channel encircled the garden on three sides and there were two entrances, one opposite the *tablinium* on the north and the other at the southeast corner of the garden. The neck of a large *dolium* formed the mouth of a well with a heavy masonry *puteal* located in the center of the garden
