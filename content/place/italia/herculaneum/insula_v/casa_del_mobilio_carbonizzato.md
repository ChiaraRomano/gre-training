## Garden Description

549.V.5.
Visible from the *fauces*, this little courtyard (a) had an elaborate *aedicula* shrine which was excavated in 1932-1933. A low double wall with a gutter bordered the courtyard on the west and north sides with a cistern opening located in the center of the west edge of garden. Four small flower beds on the sides and a circular bed in the center had raised borders to retain the water for the plants within, and the remainder of the courtyard was paved in *opus signinum*. Jashemski commented that the garden had been restored with eleven such small planting beds. The east wall had traces of an animal painting on a blue background by the *aedicula lararium*. A deer was painted on the right side and several more indistinct animal forms were noted over the *lararium*. At the south end of this wall there were traces of leaves and a lattice fence suggesting a garden painting may have been located here.
